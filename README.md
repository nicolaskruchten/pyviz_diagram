### A Fresh Look at the Python Data Visualization Landscape
#### by [Nicolas Kruchten](https://nicolas.kruchten.com)

This is [a work-in-progress diagram](https://nicolas.kruchten.com/pyviz_diagram/) meant as an update to the one on the [PyViz.org Overviews page](https://pyviz.org/overviews/) which is an adaptation by Nicolas P. Rougier of a diagram presented by Jake VanderPlas in a [PyCon 2017 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FytuB8nFHPQ).

**Note:** The diagram first shows up with all tags showing, so it looks a bit insane... the tag menu lets you turn things on and off, so try just the `mpl` tag to see just what `matplotlib` connects to, etc :)
